• What would you do if asked to code something you knew was wrong?

- I would first start by find the reasoning behind the request and try to explore other options that are not unethical and can return the same type of answer their are looking for.


• As a software developer, what are your ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

⁃ I believe the ethical responsibility of an individual developer is to make sure all user data is being handed properly and is secure and build code that makes the end user’s life easier and not hard. 

• Give an example from the readings of a standard that supports ethical programming. How does it do so?

⁃ “your knowledge gives you the privilege and the responsibility to say no when no is the answer. When the answer is no, we are the only ones who can say that. We're the only ones who know.” From CS-210 UncleBob Expecting Professionalism Kuppelsalen, Copenhagen (CC) on YouTube. 
⁃ I Believe its very important to say no when the you don’t feel comfortable doing than saying no is the right thing to do. 



• What did you do particularly well?

- I think I did a really good job of making the code modular, and some modules were reusable code that I can use to create files and to store them easily.

• Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

- I think I can make my code better by adding a third vector to store the final answers that the user can look up and the program wouldn't have to create any files in order to read the data only down fall is that the you wouldn't be able to send the sorted data to some else since the data is only stored until the program is running. But in the current program we create a file and store our data in it and the user can come back to program and run it again and this time the program would run faster since error checker lines would see the storage files is already create and it would use it as a reference instead of redoing the sorting each time the program is ran. I could also decouple the sorting method into its own file that can be called and a list can be returned and I would also decouple the create file method into its own which can create a file or return "already created" message. 

• Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

- I struggled with trying to sort the data first going from unsorted to stored and then the amount of each item. I used a reddit form that explained how to sort a vector from a-z.

• What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

- I believe the biggest skill I have taken away is making my code modular this makes managing the code much easier and easier to update as well.

• How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

- I made the names of the functions describe the function thats being called when debugging it's easier to see where the code is going and how it's being called and used. I also kept the menu print lines out of the main function to avoid clutter.
